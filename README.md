# MovieBuddy

MovieBuddy is a movie recommender system that suggests films based on a given movie. Using a movie's similarity score, the system fetches recommendations from a pre-loaded dataset and displays them along with their posters. Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface, the system leverages the TMDB API to fetch movie posters and provides a seamless experience for users to explore new films. Simply select a movie, and MovieVerse will offer five personalized movie suggestions!
